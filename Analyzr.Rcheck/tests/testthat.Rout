The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
     (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)
VIM is ready to use.

Woot woot! There are no missing values in this data set.


A number of variables failed the Shapiro-Wilk Normality test and may not be normally distributed. It is recommended to plot a histogram of each variable to verify these findings and perform the appropriate transformations if necessary prior to continuing to do correlation testing. The results for all variables with p-values and w scores can be found in the output table. 


The variables that failed the normality test are:
Sepal.Length
Petal.Length
Petal.Width
