\usage{
analyzer(data, sample_size = 50, norm_test = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing binary, continuous, nonimal factor, or ordinal factor.}

\item{sample_size}{An integer determining the sample size of each variable used for normality testing. Default is 50 or max in dataframe if less than 50.}

\item{norm_test}{True or False used to determine if Shapiro-Wilk Normality testing is conducted on variables in dataframe.}
}
\value{
A list of all variables and types, a list of missing variables, and a Shapiro-Wilk normality metric.
Places variables into new dataframes based on variable class and evaluates readiness for correlation testing
by corr_function.
